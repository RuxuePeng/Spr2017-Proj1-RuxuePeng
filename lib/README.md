# Project: 
### Code lib Folder

The lib directory contains various files with function definitions (but only function definitions - no code that actually runs).
For this project, the lib folder contains all the functions written for and used on the project.

**Each .R file has annotations in detail**, therefore please look into indivisual file for more details about certain function.
