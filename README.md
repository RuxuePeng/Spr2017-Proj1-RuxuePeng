### [Project Description](doc/)
Inspiration:  
Having won the election by one of the smallest popular vote margins in history, my favorite U.S. president has always been John F. Kennedy. J.F.Kennedy had only 49.72% of the popular vote.  But he's also remembered as a president who has delivered on of the most memorable and enduring inaugural speeches.
Is popular vote margin related to presidents' performance in composing inaugural speeches? In other words, does pressure to win back the public's heart push U.S. presidents to deliver more comprehansible and admirable inaugural speeches?
To find out the answer to this question, this project has come into being.

+ Project title: Does less popular presidents deliver better inaugural speech?
+ This project is conducted by Ruxue Peng
