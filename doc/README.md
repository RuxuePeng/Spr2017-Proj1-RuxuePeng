##Project Abstract   
  Is popular vote margin related to U.S. president's performance in inaugural speech?In easier terms, does pressure to win back the public's heart push U.S. presidents to deliver more comprehansible and admirable inaugural speeches?  
  I approach the question by first, quantify the concept of a "good" speech.I calculated the sentene length and also readability index which tells how easy a text is for people to understand, by estimating the grade level required to understand it. Secondly, I quantified the concept of "popular" and "unpopular" presidents, grouping them by vote margin. At last, I visualized the relationship by standard EDA, wordcloud, sentiment analysis plus plotted a really cool *interactive network graph*.
