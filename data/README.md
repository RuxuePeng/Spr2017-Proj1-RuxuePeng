# Project: 
### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.  
For this project, we'll use the pop_vote_margin.csv file and the inaugurals folder and the inauglist.csv file.
* pop_vote_margin.csv file     : popular vote margin of each U.S presidents since Abraham Lincoln.
* inaugurals folder            : contain the inaugural speech full text of each U.S. president
* inaugulist.csv file          : additional information about presidents' party, date of speech, etc.
